                <P>Based on the Eiffel Tower in design, Tokyo Tower was completed in 1958. At 333 meters tall, it was
                    the
                    tallest freestanding tower in the world when it was built. It remained the tallest structure in
                    Japan
                    until being surpassed by Skytree in 2010.</P>
